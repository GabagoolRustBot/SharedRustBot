# SharedRustBot

Team chat based bot using the unofficial RustPlus API by liamcottle.

https://github.com/liamcottle/rustplus.js

Not intended for public use as server.json will contain specific server information not relevant for all users

Uses server.json for entityID's and server IP/Port. Uses a user.json for user credentials. Helpful bat files for first time installs and automating basic npm/git tasks outside of terminal.
